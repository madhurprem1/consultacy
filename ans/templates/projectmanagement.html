                <blockquote>
                  Effective Project Management is one of the biggest challenges facing most organizations. Additional
                  emphasis is being placed on delivering greater returns on investment and improved service levels for
                  all strategic projects. In today's fast paced business world we find that the statistics continue to
                  show that many projects are falling short of the expectations and metrics established by senior
                  management. Additionally, the pressure to control personnel cost, leaves many businesses short of
                  highly skilled and experienced Project Managers qualified to successfully execute the fast paced
                  projects.
